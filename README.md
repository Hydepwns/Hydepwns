Hey, I am Drew. ðŸ‘‹

Currently: [Lido](https://www.lido.fi)ðŸ’§ Protocol Specialist

Previously: [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/)ðŸ˜ˆ Protocol Specialist, primarily around the Cosmos Protocol Ecosystem ðŸ›¸

In a previous life I have been a professional sailboat-er, merchant mariner (3/M deck license), and enginer working on nuclear submarines.
My professional marine engineering experience is mostly applied MechE & ElecE, but I'm self-taught/learning Web3 and software engineering.
