Hey there! 

(っ＾▿＾)۶🍺🌟🍺٩(˘◡˘ )

I am Drew. 👋

I work at [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/)😈 as a R&D Protocol Specialist, primarily around the Cosmos Protocol Ecosystem 🛸

In a previous life I have been a professional sailboater, merchant mariner (3/M deck license), and inventor building nuclear submarines.
My professional marine engineering experience is mostly applied MechE & ElecE, but I'm self-taught/learning Web3 and software engineering.
