- principles, aphorisms, pithy advice.
  - Your name is the only thing you are buried with.
  - 'growth = pain + reflection' : Seek out meaningful pain; you stop living when you stop seeking.
  - Your vulnerability is your strength, so *wield it* thoughtfully, and embrace the pain.
  - People don't remember what you said, people remember how you made them feel.
  - 'polite conversation is rarely either' : Speak truth, then calibrate after the fact.
  - Make decisions as if life was a movie; make it a movie *you* would want to watch.
  - Invest your money where you invest your time.
- writing
- books
- films
