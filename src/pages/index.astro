    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p> Welcome to my minimal, monospace (<i>specifically, [Monaspace Argon](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/)</i>) website. </p>    
    
    <p> ðŸš¨Work in progressðŸš¨ </p>

    <p>Monospace fonts are dear to many of us. Some find them more readable,
    consistent, and beautiful, than their proportional alternatives. Maybe
    weâ€™re just brainwashed from spending years in terminals? Or are we
    hopelessly nostalgic? Iâ€™m not sure. But I like them, and thatâ€™s why I
    started experimenting with all-monospace Web.</p>
    <p>On this page, I use a monospace grid to align text and draw diagrams.
    Itâ€™s generated from a simple Markdown document (using Pandoc), and the
    CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript renders it on the grid. The page is
    responsive, shrinking in character-sized steps. Standard elements should
    <em>just work</em>, at least thatâ€™s the goal. Itâ€™s semantic HTML,
    rendered as if we were back in the 70s.</p>
    <p>All right, but is this even a good idea? Itâ€™s a technical and
    creative challenge and I like the aesthetic. If youâ€™d like to use it,
    feel free to fork or copy the bits you need, respecting the license. I
    might update it over time with improvements and support for more
    standard elements.</p>
    <h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
    <p>This document uses a few extra classes here and there, but mostly
    itï¿½ï¿½s just markup. This, for instance, is a regular paragraph.</p>
    <p>Look at this horizontal break:</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Lovely. We can hide stuff in the <code>&lt;details</code>&gt;
    element:</p>
    <details>
    <summary>
    A short summary of the contents
    </summary>
    <p>
    Hidden gems.
    </p>
    </details>

    <p>They extend to the width of the page, and add appropriate padding in
    the bottom to maintain the monospace grid.</p>

    <p>Thatâ€™s it for now. Iâ€™ve very much enjoyed making this, pushing my CSS
    chops and having a lot of fun with the design. If you like it or even
    decide to use it, please <a href="https://x.com/MF_DROO">hit me
