## Introduction

Welcome to my minimal, monospace (specifically, [Monaspace Argon](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/)) website.

Some find them more readable, consistent, and beautiful, than their proportional alternatives.
Maybe we're just brainwashed from spending years in terminals?
Or are we hopelessly nostalgic?
I'm not sure.
But I like them, and that's why I started experimenting with all-monospace Web.

On this page, I use a monospace grid to align text and draw diagrams.
It's generated from a simple Markdown document (using Pandoc), and the CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript renders it on the grid.
The page is responsive, shrinking in character-sized steps.
Standard elements should _just work_, at least that's the goal.
It's semantic HTML, rendered as if we were back in the 70s.

All right, but is this even a good idea?
It's a technical and creative challenge and I like the aestethic.
If you'd like to use it, feel free to fork or copy the bits you need, respecting the license.
I might update it over time with improvements and support for more standard elements.

## The Basics

This document uses a few extra classes here and there, but mostly it's just markup.
This, for instance, is a regular paragraph.

Look at this horizontal break:

<hr>

Lovely. We can hide stuff in the `<details`> element:

<details>
<summary>A short summary of the contents</summary>
<p>Hidden gems.</p>
</details>

## Discussion

That's it for now.
I've very much enjoyed making this, pushing my CSS chops and having a lot of fun with the design.
